SoundCloud Downloader
A SoundCloud Downloader built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) that allows users to download their favorite SoundCloud tracks quickly and efficiently. Users simply input the SoundCloud track link, and the application retrieves and downloads the track within seconds using an external API.

Features:
User-Friendly Interface: Simple and clean UI for entering track links.
Fast Downloads: Tracks are downloaded in just a few seconds.
External API Integration: Seamlessly integrates with an external API to process downloads.
Secure and Reliable: Built with robust backend architecture for a smooth experience.

Tech Stack:
Frontend:
React.js: For creating an interactive and responsive user interface.
Bootstrap: For styling and a mobile-friendly design.

Backend:
Node.js: Server-side runtime for handling requests.
Express.js: Backend framework for building the API.

External API:
An external API is used for retrieving and downloading tracks from SoundCloud.

How It Works:
Input Track Link: The user enters the SoundCloud track URL into the input field.
API Request: The backend sends the URL to the external API for processing.
Download: Once the track is processed, the file is downloaded to the user's device.
